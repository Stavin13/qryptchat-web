# Private Key Import/Export Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented for the private key import/export functionality in QryptChat. The implementation follows industry best practices for secure key management and cryptographic operations.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Password-Based Key Derivation (PBKDF)

- **Implementation**: Uses HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function) with SHA-256
- **Salt**: Each export uses a unique, cryptographically secure random salt (32 bytes)
- **Purpose**: Derives a strong encryption key from user-provided passwords
- **Protection**: Prevents rainbow table attacks and ensures unique keys even with identical passwords

### 2. Authenticated Encryption

- **Algorithm**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 (quantum-resistant symmetric encryption)
- **Nonce**: Each export uses a unique, cryptographically secure random nonce (12 bytes)
- **Authentication**: Built-in authentication prevents tampering with encrypted data
- **Benefits**: Provides both confidentiality and integrity protection

### 3. Secure Random Number Generation

- **Source**: Uses `crypto.getRandomValues()` for all random data generation
- **Applications**: 
  - Salt generation (32 bytes)
  - Nonce generation (12 bytes)
  - Key generation (32 bytes)
- **Quality**: Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG)

### 4. Memory Security

- **Secure Clearing**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory using `CryptoUtils.secureClear()`
- **Scope**: Applied to:
  - Derived encryption keys
  - Password bytes
  - Decrypted key material
- **Purpose**: Prevents sensitive data from lingering in memory

### 5. Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters (enforced in UI)
- **File Format Validation**: Strict JSON schema validation for import files
- **Version Compatibility**: Checks export format version to prevent incompatible imports
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information

### 6. Export Format Security

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "timestamp": 1693123456789,
  "encryptedKeys": "base64-encoded-encrypted-data",
  "salt": "base64-encoded-salt",
  "nonce": "base64-encoded-nonce"
}
```

- **Versioning**: Allows for future format upgrades while maintaining compatibility
- **Timestamp**: Helps with key lifecycle management
- **Base64 Encoding**: Safe transport encoding for binary data

### 7. Client-Side Only Operations

- **Local Processing**: All encryption/decryption happens in the browser
- **No Server Storage**: Private keys never leave the user's device during export/import
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Server has no access to user's private keys or passwords

## Security Best Practices Followed

### 1. Defense in Depth

- Multiple layers of security (encryption, authentication, validation)
- Fail-safe defaults (secure by default configuration)
- Principle of least privilege (minimal required permissions)

### 2. Cryptographic Standards

- **NIST Approved**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 is NIST-approved for government use
- **Quantum Resistant**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 provides post-quantum security
- **Key Sizes**: Uses appropriate key sizes (256-bit keys, 96-bit nonces)

### 3. Error Handling

- **Information Disclosure**: Error messages don't reveal sensitive information
- **Graceful Degradation**: Failures don't compromise security
- **Logging**: Security events are logged without exposing sensitive data

### 4. User Experience Security

- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Allows users to verify password entry
- **Confirmation Fields**: Prevents typos in critical operations
- **Clear Warnings**: Users are informed about security implications
- **File Validation**: Immediate feedback on invalid import files

## Threat Model Coverage

### 1. Passive Attacks

- **Eavesdropping**: Encrypted exports are safe even if intercepted
- **Traffic Analysis**: No network traffic contains sensitive key material
- **Storage Analysis**: Exported files are encrypted and authenticated

### 2. Active Attacks

- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Not applicable (client-side only operations)
- **Tampering**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 authentication prevents modification
- **Replay Attacks**: Unique nonces prevent replay of encrypted data

### 3. Offline Attacks

- **Brute Force**: HKDF with salt makes password cracking computationally expensive
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Salt prevents precomputed dictionary attacks
- **Rainbow Tables**: Unique salts make rainbow tables ineffective

### 4. Implementation Attacks

- **Side Channel**: Uses constant-time operations where possible
- **Memory Disclosure**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory
- **Timing Attacks**: Validation uses constant-time comparison

## Compliance and Standards

### 1. Industry Standards

- **OWASP**: Follows OWASP cryptographic storage guidelines
- **NIST**: Uses NIST-approved cryptographic algorithms
- **RFC Standards**: Implements RFC-compliant HKDF and ChaCha20-Poly1305

### 2. Regulatory Considerations

- **GDPR**: User controls their own key export/import (data portability)
- **Privacy**: No sensitive data is transmitted to servers
- **Audit Trail**: Operations are logged for security monitoring

## Testing and Validation

### 1. Unit Tests

- **Cryptographic Functions**: All crypto operations are thoroughly tested
- **Edge Cases**: Tests cover error conditions and boundary cases
- **Security Properties**: Tests verify encryption, authentication, and key derivation

### 2. Integration Tests

- **End-to-End**: Complete export/import workflows are tested
- **Cross-Platform**: Tests ensure compatibility across different environments
- **Error Scenarios**: Tests verify secure error handling

### 3. Security Testing

- **Fuzzing**: Input validation is tested with malformed data
- **Negative Testing**: Tests verify rejection of invalid inputs
- **Timing Analysis**: Operations are tested for timing consistency

## Recommendations for Users

### 1. Password Security

- Use strong, unique passwords for key exports
- Consider using a password manager
- Don't reuse passwords from other services
- Store passwords securely and separately from exported files

### 2. File Security

- Store exported key files in secure locations
- Consider additional encryption for long-term storage
- Regularly rotate and re-export keys
- Securely delete old export files

### 3. Operational Security

- Verify file integrity before importing
- Use trusted devices for key operations
- Keep software updated
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Potential Improvements

- **Hardware Security**: Integration with hardware security modules (HSMs)
- **Multi-Factor**: Additional authentication factors for key operations
- **Key Escrow**: Optional secure key backup services
- **Audit Logging**: Enhanced security event logging

### 2. Cryptographic Upgrades

- **Post-Quantum**: Migration to post-quantum key exchange algorithms
- **Algorithm Agility**: Support for multiple encryption algorithms
- **Key Rotation**: Automated key rotation capabilities

## Conclusion

The private key import/export functionality implements robust security measures that protect user keys throughout the export/import process. The implementation follows industry best practices and provides strong protection against both passive and active attacks while maintaining usability for end users.

All cryptographic operations use well-established, secure algorithms and are implemented following security best practices. The client-side-only approach ensures that sensitive key material never leaves the user's control, providing maximum security and privacy.
